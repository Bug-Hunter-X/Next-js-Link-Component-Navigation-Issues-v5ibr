# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component: unexpected navigation behavior.  The issue manifests as links appearing correctly but failing to navigate to the intended pages. This might be due to incorrect href values, missing pages, or issues with the Next.js routing configuration.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the links on the rendered page.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the href values in the Link components and ensuring that the target pages exist and are correctly configured within the Next.js application's routing structure. Additionally, check your `pages` directory to make sure the pages your links are pointing to exist.  Verify that there are no typos in your route definitions.
